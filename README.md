Suicide is still one of the world's most important public health issues, with the World Health 
Organization (WHO) claiming that over 700,000 people die by suicide annually. Suicide is one 
of the main causes of death, with far-reaching consequences for people, families, and society. 
Understanding the global patterns and trends in suicide rates is critical for creating effective 
prevention methods and providing the required support to at-risk individuals.
The purpose of this report is to visualize global data on suicides using the WHO dataset 
(who_suicide_statistics.csv). This dataset has statistics on the number of suicides in various 
countries, years, age categories, and sexes. By analyzing this data, it will guide us to learn about 
demographic and temporal patterns of suicide, show high-risk groups, and highlight regions 
facing significant challenges. The visualizations will employ various techniques such as 
graphs, charts, and maps to effectively convey the information and guide the viewer through 
the findings. Through these visualizations and insights, I suggested key points and 
recommendations needed to minimize suicide incidents in future.
